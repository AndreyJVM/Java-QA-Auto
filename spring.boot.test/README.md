## Spring Boot Test Framework

The Spring Boot Test project is a set of tools and extensions for testing Spring Boot applications.
It simplifies the process of writing and executing tests by providing ready-made solutions for various 
testing scenarios.

### Key Features

2. **Support for RESTful Service Testing:** Built-in tools for testing RESTful APIs, including support for mock services and integration with test HTTP clients.
3. **Test Data Isolation:** The ability to use embedded databases for tests, allowing for isolation of test data and avoiding conflicts with main application data.
4. **Extensibility:** Support for custom test configurations and extensions, enabling adaptation of the framework to specific project needs.
