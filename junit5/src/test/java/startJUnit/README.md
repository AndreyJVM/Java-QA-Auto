In this package, we introduced the basics of the brand-new programming model of the **JUnit 5** framework,
knows as **Jupiter**. This programming model provides a rich API that can be used by practitioners to create
test cases. The most basic element of Jupiter is the annotation `@Test`, which identifies the methods in Java
classes treads as tests (that is logic which exercises and verifiers a SUT). Moreover, there are different 
annotations that  can be used to control the test life cycle, namely, `@BeforeAll`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach` and
`@AfterAll`.
